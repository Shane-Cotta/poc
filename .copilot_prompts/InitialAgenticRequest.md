Django POC that scans an incoming/ folder every 2 min for CSV files (zip,email), calls https://api.zippopotam.us/us/{zip} to get the state, writes results to processed/, and emails each address using Djangoâ€™s console backend. Include Django project/app, management command, tests, .devcontainer for VS Code + Copilot, and .copilot_prompts/ with prompt logs.

### Reasons behind the prompt above
1) I request a devcontainer for application portability and easy setup in VS Code with GitHub Copilot.
2) By requesting the .copilot_prompts/ directory with prompt logs, i can force the Copilot agent to leverage itself in the development process to generate code snippets and implementations of
it's own "thought process" for building the application.
    - This forces copilot effectivly asks "itself" for code generation and implementation ideas, rather than relying solely on the initial prompt from the user.

You can see the agentic inital pull request the agent created for my review here:
https://github.com/Shane-Cotta/poc/pull/1

You can then see my next commit history where I modifying the code generated by copilot to reach the final implementation seen in this repository.
